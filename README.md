Goal: To create a basic, interactive, and visually clean trivia game.

MVP: A basic site that allows for the initialization of a trivia game with 10 random questions. Instant feedback on submitting an answer. Questions will be displayed either as a list or on a carousel. A unique key will be generated for each user so that questions will not be repeated.

Stretch 1: Initializing a quiz will provide options to configure the topic, difficulty, and amount of questions per quiz.

Stretch 2: Add about page to site.

Stretch 3: Find a way to save scores and display them, either locally or on a server.
